Doomsday Database was our first class project. Working in a team of 3, we delegated different tasks to each team member. The asssignment was to utilize 2 API's to request information from those servers and somehow integrate the received data into a project of our own. The hardest part of the assignment was creating markers to append to the map after an Ajax call received the data. The problems I personally faced was the design and javascript. I constantly second guessed myself and would attempt code and then delete after I couldn't get it to work. After more attempts, I found out the code I had was right. 

Instructions:

A user will type in a year and receive results on the map of where meteors have struck earth. The user can either select a single meteor strike or show all by selecting the display all button.
