# DoomsDay Database


## Technologies
Doomsday Database was our first class project. Working in a team of 3, we delegated different tasks to each team member. The asssignment was to utilize 2 API's to request information from those servers and somehow integrate the received data into a project of our own. The hardest part of the assignment was creating markers to append to the map after an Ajax call received the data.

## Instructions

A user will type in a year and receive results on the map of where meteors have struck earth. The user can either select a single meteor strike or show all by selecting the display all button.
